# Google Contacts Events Notifier

![Logo](images/Logo_alpha.png)

Receive customized email notifications to alert you about incoming birthdays or
other events of your Google contacts.

Have you ever wondered why on Earth would Google Calendar provide a calendar to
remind you of your contact birthdays, but without letting you set up notifications
for its events?  
I did. And after hours of fruitless searching and browsing I found [a post in
the Google Help Forum][Original Google Help Forum Post] which seemed to provide
a solution, however it did not quite work.

This project takes inspiration from that code to solve the problem of the
missing notifications on Google Calendar Birthday Calendar.

## Installation and setup

Follow [this guide][Setup and installation guide] to install and setup the script
correctly.

## Additional information

### Stopping/uninstalling/deleting the script

If you just want to stop receiving the notifications, but want to keep the script
for future use just open your script and click `Run->notifStop` in the menu at
the top.

If you want to stop using the script and want to delete it completely follow these
steps:

1. Locate the script in [Google Drive][Google Drive website]:
   - It should be in the folder you put it into when you created it.
   - If you deleted the file you can look in the [trash folder][Google Drive trash]
     and recover it from there.
2. Open the script and click `Run->notifStop` in the menu at the top.
3. In the same menu click `Run->notifStatus`, then `View->Log` and confirm
   that the notifications were stopped successfully.
4. Close the script and open [this Google page][Google connected apps], find the
   the script (it should have the name you gave it during installation) and click
   on "Remove access"
5. If everything went right it should be safe to delete the script file from Google
   Drive.  
   If you want to be extra sure you can wait some days to confirm that no email is
   sent to you anymore and only then delete the script file: this is up to you.

### Translation

The text of the email notification can be translated into any language if a
translation for that language is provided to the script. Soe languages already
have a translation, but you can easily add your own.

To learn more about translations (how to create your own one, how to share
it with us so that it can be used by other users...) please read the
[translation guide][Translation guide].

### Bug and error reporting, help requests

First of all _before submitting a new error, bug or help request_, please,
__verify that you followed [the setup instructions][Project documentation] to the
letter.__

To report a bug or an error or to request help with this script please use [this
project GitHub issue page][Project issue page]: the collaborators will be notified
immediately and will provide help as soon as possible.

Please follow the [template provided][Issue template file] when opening a new issue
and include:

- A __meaningful description of the problem__. What did you do? What happened?
  What did you expect to happen instead?
- A __full copy of any error message you received or of the thing that went
  wrong__. Please be advised that it could contain personal information such as
  your email: obscure or remove them as all the issues and relative messages are
  publicly visible.

These pieces of information are really necessary: without them nobody will be able
to help you.

#### Unresponsive help requests

If you open a help request issue please do not abandon it until it's been solved
and closed. If you want to close it before explicitly state this intention with
a message in the issue.

Issues marked with the `help request` tag that are unresponsive will be sent a
reminder message after three days since the last message from the user and the
issue will be marked with the `unresponsive` tag. If the user still does not
respond to the issue, after a month the issue will be closed.

If you want to re-open a closed `help request` issue ask for this by commenting
on it.  
Only the user which has originally opened the issue can ask for it to be
re-opened.

### Updating the script

This script is constantly updated to fix bugs and add new features: keeping it
updated to the latest version is really easy:

1. Whenever a new stable version is released you will see a line of text at the
   end of your daily email notification telling you to click on a link to get the
   latest version;
2. If you do so you will be taken to a page with a description of the new release;
3. The description will contain a precise step by step guide on how to update the
   script to this version: follow it closely and you should not have any problem;
4. You might want to follow the setup procedure again, because some steps might
   have been added in the new version since the previous one.
5. After updating the code always click `Run->notifStop` and `Run->notifStart`
   in the top menu to finish the update process.

Note: you might be asked to grant some new permissions to the script. There is
nothing wrong with this: it just means that the new version requires some permissions
that the previous version did not.  
You can read the full list of the permissions and why they are required
[here][Permissions list]

### Permissions required

When running the script for the first time or after an update you might be asked
by Google to "grant some permissions" to the script. This happens because the script
needs your explicit permission to access your data.

This is an exhaustive description of the reason the script needs each of the permissions:

- **Know your age range and language + View your email addresses**  
  This is needed to retrieve information about your Google Plus contacts, especially
  those who you have not added in your Google Contacts, but just followed on Google
  Plus. The script will only get information about people who appear in your birthday
  calendar. If you prefer to not access Google Plus at all set
  `settings.user.accessGooglePlus = false` before running any functions and do not
  enable the Google+ API.
- **Manage your Google Contacts**  
  This lets the script access information about your contacts (names, email
  addresses, birthdays). The script will not modify any of your contacts.
- **Manage your calendars**  
  This lets the script access your birthday and events calendar. The script
  will get the events from this calendar only and will never modify any event or
  calendar.
- **Allow this application to run when you are not present**  
  This is needed to run the script every day at the hour you specified.
- **Send email as you**  
  Obviously this script needs your authorization to send you the email notifications.
  It won't send any other email to anyone.
- **Connect to an external service**  
  This permission is needed to check for updates and to load the profile images of
  your contacts.
