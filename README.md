# Google Contacts Events Notifier

![Logo](images/Logo_alpha.png)

Receive customized email notifications to alert you about incoming birthdays or
other events of your Google contacts.

Have you ever wondered why on Earth would Google Calendar provide a calendar to
remind you of your contact birthdays, but without letting you set up notifications
for its events?  
I did. And after hours of fruitless searching and browsing I found [a post in
the Google Help Forum][Original Google Help Forum Post] which seemed to provide
a solution, however it did not quite work.

This project takes inspiration from that code to solve the problem of the
missing notifications on Google Calendar Birthday Calendar.

## How to setup

### Enable the calendar

First of all you need to enable your contacts birthday and events calendar in
you Google Calendar (read [this Google help page][Google setup birthday
calendar] to know how to do it).

### Create the script

Copy the whole content of [this file][Main code file].  
Open [Google Script][Google scripts website] and login if requested, then paste
the code into the page.

### Customize the script

Now read carefully the code you've pasted. At the top of the file you will find
some lines you need to modify along with many lines of instructions. Edit the
values as explained by the instructions.  

Once you're done editing the variables click `File->Save` in the menu and enter a
name for the script (it doesn't really matter, just name it so that you'll
recognize it if you find it in the future).

The customization variables can be categorized in three groups.

#### Mandatory customization

These are the first settings you will find: these are variables that you
**must** initialize correctly, otherwise the script will not work at all.  
These are the names of the variables:

- `settings.user.googleEmail`
- `settings.user.notificationEmail`
- `settings.user.calendarId`

#### Optional customization

This second groups of settings contains some variables than you could leave as
they are, but you are warmly encouraged to edit them, so as to fit your exact
needs.  
These are the names of the variables:

- `settings.user.emailSenderName`
- `settings.user.lang`
- `settings.user.accessGooglePlus`
- `settings.notifications.hour`
- `settings.notifications.timeZone`
- `settings.notifications.anticipateDays`
- `settings.notifications.eventTypes`
- `settings.notifications.maxEmailsCount`
- `settings.notifications.maxPhonesCount`
- `settings.notifications.indentSize`
- `settings.notifications.compactGrouping`

#### Debugging options

Variables in this group are used to debug and troubleshoot the
script when it does not work as intended. Generally you should not need to
edit these values, but you may be asked to do so if you submit a help
request.  
These are the names of the variables:

- `settings.debug.log.filterLevel`
- `settings.debug.log.sendTrigger`
- `settings.debug.testDate`

#### Developer options

This list just provides a convenient place for the developers and/or
maintainers to update variables without searching through the code. For normal
use you should never need or want to edit these.

- `settings.developer.version`
- `settings.developer.repoName`
- `settings.developer.gitHubBranch`

### Activate API for the script

Now that the script is saved in your Google Drive folder we need to activate it.
To do so click the menu `Resources->Advanced Google services`.  
In the popup which will open set "Calendar API" to `enabled` (click the
switch on its row on the right) and press "Okay".  
Once you have done this open `Resources->Advanced Google services` again and 
click on the link which says "Google API Console": you
will be taken to another page. In this page search for "Google Calendar API" and
open it. Now click `Enable` at the top of the window and close this page.  
Unless you have set the `accessGooglePlus` setting to `false`, then repeat these
steps for "Google+ API". Set it to `enabled` in the list, click on the "Google
API Console" link, search for "Google+ API" and activate it.
That's it for this step.

**Important note**: please double check that you have performed **all** steps
correctly as this seems to be the cause of many reported errors.

### Grant rights to the script

We have given the script access to the resource it needs to work: now the last
step is granting it the rights to access those resources. To do so click on the
menu `Run->notifStart`. You will be prompted to "Review authorizations": do it
and click `Allow` (You can read the full list of the permissions and why they
are required [here][Permissions list]).
From this moment on you will always receive an email before any of your
contacts' birthday (You should have set how many days before at the beginning).

## Additional information

### Translation

If you want to add a new translation of the notifications, open your script,
find the line `var i18n` and have a look at the structure of the translation
object and at the instructions at the end.

To add a new language:

- find the block of code which represents one existing translation and copy it,
  for example:  

  ```javascript
  'it': {
    'Age': 'Età',
    ...
    'Main phone': 'Telefono principale',
  },
  ```

- paste it just below itself, like this:

  ```javascript
  'it': {
    'Age': 'Età',
    ...
    'Main phone': 'Telefono principale',
  },
  'it': {
    'Age': 'Età',
    ...
    'Main phone': 'Telefono principale',
  },
  ```

- replace the language code of your translation with your language code and
  proceed to translate every item in the list, leaving the string on the left of
  the `:` unchanged and translating the one on the right, like this:

  ```javascript
  'it': {
    'Age': 'Età',
    ...
    'Main phone': 'Telefono principale',
  },
  'de' : {
    'Age': 'Alter',
    ...
    'Main phone': 'Hauptnummer',
  },
  ```

If you want to share your translation with other users please open an issue or a
pull request on [Github][Project main page]. I will be glad to add your
translation to the script.

### Stop the notifications

To stop receiving these notifications simply open the script (which you'll find
[in Google Drive][Google Drive website] if you haven't moved it) and click the
menu `Run->notifStop`.

### Bug and error reporting, help requests

First of all _before submitting a new error, bug or help request_, please,
__verify that you followed [the instructions][Project documentation] to the
letter.__

To report a bug or an error or to request help with this script please use [this
project GitHub issue page][Project issue page]: I will be notified immediately
and will provide help as soon as possible.

In the text of the message please follow the [template provided][Issue template
file] and include:

- A __meaningful description of the problem__. What did you do? What happened?
  What did you expect to happen instead?
- A __full copy of any error message you received or of the thing that went
  wrong__. Please be advised that it could contain personal information such as
  your email: obscure or remove them as all the issues and relative messages are
  publicly visible.

I really need these information: without them I will not be able to help you.

#### Unresponsive help requests

If you open a help request issue please do not abandon it until it's been solved
and closed. If you want to close it before explicitly state this intention with
a message in the issue.

Issues marked with the `help request` tag that are unresponsive will be sent a
reminder message after three days since the last message from the user and the
issue will be marked with the `unresponsive` tag. If the user still does not
respond to the issue, after a month the issue will be closed.

If you want to re-open a closed `help request` issue ask for this by commenting
on it.  
Only the user which has originally opened the issue can ask for it to be
re-opened.

### Testing the script

If you want to test the script, but during these days none of your contacts have
a birthday you can use the `test()` function.

To do so, open the script and edit the `fakeTestDate` variable in the debugging
configuration section. You just need to replace the example date with the date
you want to test, then click `Run->test` in the menu at the top of the page.
If everything went right you should receive a birthday notification exactly like
if today was the date you set.

### Updating the script

This script is constantly updated to fix bugs and add new features: keeping it
updated to the latest version is really easy:

1. Whenever a new stable version is released you will see a lien of text at the
   end of your daily email notification telling you to click on a link to get the
   latest version;
2. If you do so you will be taken to a page with a description of the new release;
3. The description will contain a precise step by step guide on how to update the
   script to this version: follow it closely and you should not have any problem;
4. After updating the code always click `Run->notifStop` and `Run->notifStart`
   in the top menu to finish the update process.  
   Note: you might be asked to grant some new permissions to the script. There is
   nothing wrong with this: it just means that the new version requires some permissions
   that the previous version did not.  
   You can read the full list of the permissions and why they are required
   [here][Permissions list]

### Permissions required

When running the script for the first time or after an update you might be asked
by Google to "grant some permissions" to the script. This happens because the script
needs your explicit permission to access your data.

This is an exhaustive description of the reason the script needs each of the permissions:

- **Know your age range and language + View your email addresses**  
  This is needed to retrieve information about your Google Plus contacts, especially
  those who you have not added in your Google Contacts, but just followed on Google
  Plus. The script will only get information about people who appear in your birthday
  calendar. If you prefer to not access Google Plus at all set
  `settings.user.accessGooglePlus = false` before running any functions and do not
  enable the Google+ API.
- **Manage your Google Contacts**  
  This lets the script access information about your contacts (names, email
  addresses, birthdays). The script will not modify any of your contacts.
- **Manage your calendars**  
  This lets the script access your birthday and events calendar. The script
  will get the events from this calendar only and will never modify any event or
  calendar.
- **Allow this application to run when you are not present**  
  This is needed to run the script every day at the hour you specified.
- **Send email as you**  
  Obviously this script needs your authorization to send you the email notifications.
  It won't send any other email to anyone.
- **Connect to an external service**  
  This permission is needed to check for updates and to load the profile images of
  your contacts.
