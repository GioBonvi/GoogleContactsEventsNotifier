# Contributing

Welcome, user!  
As you might know Google Calendar Birthday Notifications is an open source
project: any kind of help or contribution is therefore warmly welcomed.  
When I started working on this project I just wanted to solve a problem that I
was experiencing with Google Calendar, but it all went much further than I could
expect: people liked the idea and helped making it even better.  
If you now want to be part of this group and give your own contribution this
page contains useful information.

## Where to start

First of all make sure you have read the [Code of conduct][Code of conduct]: it
does not contain any extremely bizarre or revolutionary rules. Following common
sense and being nice to other users will create you no problem at all.

Now let the fun begin! There are many ways you can contribute to this project:

- are there [unsolved issues][Project issue page]? Look around: there might be
  some you can solve or help closing;
- have you thought of a feature which would improve this project but don't know
  how to code it? You can create an issue with a feature request detailing what
  you thought and your proposal will be evaluated by the developers;
- are you a developer yourself? You can fork the project and the create a Pull
  Request with your edited code. Just make sure you follow the [coding
  guidelines][Coding guidelines];
- do you speak a foreign language? You can [contribute][contribute with
  translation] by submitting a new translation in the form of a Pull Request or
  by creating an issue if you don't know how to create Pull Requests;

## Code of conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct][Code of
conduct]: it's a simple set of rules that greatly help collaborating, making the
project easier to maintain.

## Issues

[Issues][Project issue page] are a powerful tool provided by GitHub to report
problems, ask questions and more generally letting users interact with the
developers of a project: they, however, are only useful as long as they are used
correctly.  
This project has few rules regarding issues:

- help requests in the issues are accepted as long as you first read everything
  else and nothing you have tried works;
- when reporting an issue please follow the [template provided][Issue template
  file];

## Coding guidelines

Code consistency is what makes a project maintainable and accessible to
everyone. To maintain consistency please make sure that your code submitted via
Pull Requests complies with these rules:

- the code must be in english (variable names, comments, documentation...);
- the code in `.gs` files must be formatted following the [Javascript
  Semistandard Style][Javascript semistandard];
- the text in `.md` files must be formatted using to [this Markdown
  Linter][Markdown linter] (available as a plugin for many editors);
  - deviations from default rules can be found in the [.markdownlint.json
    file][Markdown linter config]
  - additionally, links should be in the reference format, not in the in-text format
